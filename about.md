> We're stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.
> (Douglas Adams)

I hate coffee in cheap foam cups. The unsettling way it seeps through the pores, longing to escape its possibly carcinogenic confines, is a visceral reminder of the taste: stale, plastic, and hot without warmth. I'm not too proud to down a Folger's; I have a taste for a well-made Sumatran pour-over, but not a requirement for one. I recognize the reality and utility of a fast cup of coffee to get the job done: put warmth in the bones and caffeine in the bloodstream. I don't need cream, sugar, *et al*; I don't believe in depriving oneself of savor, even if its the less pleasant bitterness of a cheap coffee, it is still a thing to be experienced. Just, don't put it in those horrid foam cups, okay?

Now that we're through that, I trust we have a better understanding.

My job has nothing to do with coffee, but if you're in my line of work and don't have strong opinions about things like coffee, you can't think correctly. I'm a Systems Administrator and Architect, which means I wrangle blinking rectangles[^dasblinkenlights], and try to design and build some nice homes for them to live in.

Specifically, I work with information technology systems, which historically meant "computers doing stuff". This hasn't changed; there's still computers, and they still do stuff, but nowadays we tend to think more about the *stuff* and less about the computers, primarily because of all the thrilling and maddening ways that have come about to make more stuff happen across more (and less) computers in different ways. Functioning software is the apparent outcome of what I do. It's also the most important part, because that's what people care about and are willing to pay for: they want to use software to make their jobs and lives better.

Unfortunately, there's a fairly sizable obstacle standing in the way of functioning software. It is a knotted mass of strings, wound and tied haphazardly around each other. These strings are problems, like:

-   Computers and other hardware stuff break in some way.

-   Software sometimes has bugs in it, so it doesn't do what it should.

-   Software sometimes has features in it, so it does things not everyone wants it to do[^notabug].

-   There's software that supports the software customers are thinking about, and that stuff has the same problems as above.

-   People don't press the right buttons, causing some combination of the above to be presented as a now-critical issue.[^didtheybreakit]

-   For the stuff to work in the first place, it must have been done with hardware and software that agrees with each other, which is in turn its own ball of string.

My job is divided between trying to do things right the first time (Architecture), maintaining things to, where possible, avoid the aforementioned knotted mass (Administration, part 1) and suffering for when it isn't (Administration, part 2). This is a good fit for me, I think. I own what I dream up, which makes my dreams much more lucid. It also means that I can administrate from a "this ought to have happened better" mindset, which is both conductive to doing it better myself, and understanding the less readily apparent "better" some systems are, despite my differences of opinion on what better should be.

I like to think about the technical and the philosophical aspects of today's information technology field. I even more like hearing and sharing similar thoughts with others. I find we IT humans are a philosophical, overall humorous lot. I think the humor stems from reconciling the maddening duality of what seems a rigorous, scientific process sort of job with a frank realization that there's a definitely unscientific art to managing, designing, or developing these things. This happens because people are involved, and though we're often reluctant to admit it, this is what makes the work actually interesting to do.

I'll write about these sort of things, and also some non-introspective technical stuff I'd like to share, because too much navel-gazing is bad for the neck.

In true fashion, I'll conclude with the obligatory: my statements and opinions are my own, and don't necessarily represent my employer, or anyone else. Your opinions are your own, too. I have comments enabled on my articles; you may share them there. I guarantee no results beyond catharsis. You can delete them within an hour, which, I can assure you, is plenty of time to regret typing something foolish. There's a [license for the site](/rights); you can read that if you want to make these words appear elsewhere in the world. Whether the world does (or should) take umbrage when you do this is not explicitly dealt with here.

[^dasblinkenlights]: I'd be remiss to not recall here "[DAS BLINKENLIGHTS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights)", which sums up the regretful kind of humor from which my profession stems.

[^notabug]: A common joke among developers is that some problem with their software is "not a bug, it's a feature". This doesn't matter; disliked features are relative bugs.

[^didtheybreakit]: Whether this is a correct perception in any way varies by situation, and is left as an exercise for the observer.
